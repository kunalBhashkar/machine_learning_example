This repository includes **Python implementations of Sutton's &amp; Barto's Reinforcement Learning Book (Ed. 2) algorithms**. The latest draft of the book's second version can be found in this [link](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html ). In this repository you may also find the solutions of the book exercises that I've been implementing.

## Course Overview

- Building various deep learning agents (including DQN and A3C)
- We can Apply a variety of advanced reinforcement learning algorithms to any problem
- Q-Learning with Deep Neural Networks
- Policy Gradient Methods with Neural Networks
- Reinforcement Learning with RBF Networks
- Use Convolutional Neural Networks with Deep Q-Learning

## Structure

### Folder
This repository is divided into **several folders, every example is related to Reinforcement Learning algo. 

Additionally, `notebooks` sub-folder is present. Such files are interactive Jupyter Notebooks, where users can interact with OpenAI environments and the algorithms available.

## Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run a jupyter process in order to visualize and interact with all the available Jupyter notebooks:

```
jupyter notebook .

```
